# Problem 1

### **Projectile Motion: Description and Formulas**  

**Projectile motion** is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration due to gravity. It follows a **parabolic trajectory** due to the combination of constant horizontal velocity and vertically accelerated motion.  

### **Key Assumptions**  
1. Air resistance is negligible.  
2. The acceleration due to gravity (**g**) is constant (≈ 9.81 m/s² downward).  
3. The motion occurs in two dimensions:  
   - **Horizontal (x-axis)**: No acceleration, constant velocity.  
   - **Vertical (y-axis)**: Acceleration due to gravity.  

### **Equations of Projectile Motion**  

#### **1. Components of Initial Velocity**  
If an object is launched with an initial velocity \( v_0 \) at an angle \( \theta \), its horizontal and vertical components are:  
\[
v_{0x} = v_0 \cos\theta
\]
\[
v_{0y} = v_0 \sin\theta
\]

#### **2. Time of Flight**  
Total time the projectile stays in the air:  
\[
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}
\]
(Valid for projectiles that land at the same height they were launched from.)  

#### **3. Maximum Height**  
The highest point reached by the projectile:  
\[
H = \frac{v_0^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g}
\]

#### **4. Horizontal Range**  
The total horizontal distance traveled:  
\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
\]

#### **5. Position at Any Time (t)**  
- **Horizontal position (x):**  
  \[
  x = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \cos\theta) t
  \]
- **Vertical position (y):**  
  \[
  y = (v_0 \sin\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  \]

#### **6. Velocity at Any Time (t)**  
- **Horizontal velocity:** \( v_x = v_0 \cos\theta \) (constant)  
- **Vertical velocity:**  
  \[
  v_y = v_0 \sin\theta - g t
  \]
- **Magnitude of velocity at time \( t \):**  
  \[
  v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}
  \]
