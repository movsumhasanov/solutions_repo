It follows a parabolic trajectory due to the combination of constant horizontal velocity and vertically accelerated motion. Key Assumptions Air resistance is negligible. The acceleration due to gravity ( g ) is constant (\u2248 9.81 m/s\u00b2 downward). The motion occurs in two dimensions: Horizontal (x-axis) : No acceleration, constant velocity. Vertical (y-axis) : Acceleration due to gravity. Equations of Projectile Motion 1. Components of Initial Velocity If an object is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) , its horizontal and vertical components are: [ v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta ] [ v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta ] 2. Time of Flight Total time the projectile stays in the air: [ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} ] (Valid for projectiles that land at the same height they were launched from.) 3. Maximum Height The highest point reached by the projectile: [ H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g} ] 4. Horizontal Range The total horizontal distance traveled: [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} ] 5. Position at Any Time (t) Horizontal position (x): [ x = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t ] Vertical position (y): [ y = (v_0 \\sin\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] 6. Velocity at Any Time (t) Horizontal velocity: \\( v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\) (constant) Vertical velocity: [ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t ] Magnitude of velocity at time \\( t \\) : [ v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} ]","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-description-and-formulas","text":"Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration due to gravity.
